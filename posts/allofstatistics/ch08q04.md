We show here that the number of possible bootstrap samples $X_1^*, \dotsc, X_n^*$ is

$$
{2n - 1 \choose n - 1}.
$$

given a sample $X_1, \dotsc, X_n$.

In fact, we prove the more general result that the number of ways of choosing a sample (with replacement) of size k from n objects is

$$
{n + k - 1 \choose n - 1}.
$$

## Wrong Solution

It is tempting to answer that there are $n^n$ possibilities with the reasoning that there are n free choices for n balls.
However, this overcounts the possibilities, which can be verified by hand in the simple case where $n=k=2$.

## Correct Solution

The proof actually counts the number of ways to write down a solution using a certain notation called [stars and bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_and_bars_(combinatorics)).
Consider each of our observations, $X_i$, as a bucket and each choice as a ball that we put into a bucket.
By drawing the k balls in a row, we can show which bucket they fall into by separating the balls with a line.  For example, for $n=4$ and $k=3$, the choice $X_3, X_4, X_4$ would be written

Similarly, we can write all solutions for $n=2, k=3$ as

The crucial point to note is that we always use $n + k - 1$ symbols for a solution: $n-1$ bars and $k$ balls.
Any ordering of these symbols is a solution so we just need to figure out how many orderings there are.
The positions of the bars completely determine the positions of the stars.
There are $n + k - 1$ positions in total and we choose $n-1$ of these to be bars, so there are

$$
{n + k - 1 \choose n - 1}
$$

possible solutions.

## Example

Here are all 10 possibilities for $n=k=3$.
