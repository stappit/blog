This post contains my solutions to the exercises in chapter 5 of Okasaki's 'Purely Functional Data Structures'.
The latest source code can be found in [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/stappit/okasaki-pfds).

Exercise 5.1
------------

1.  Implement deques.
2.  Prove that each deque operation takes $\mathcal O (1)$ amortised time using the potential $$\Phi (f, r) = \left| \left|f\right| - \left|r\right| \right|.$$

Solution 5.1
------------

**Item 1.**

See [source](https://github.com/stappit/okasaki-pfds/blob/master/src/Chap05/Data/BatchedQueue.hs).

**Item 2.**

By symmetry, the costs of `cons`, `head`, and `tail` are (almost) identical to those of `snoc`, `last`, and `init`, respectively.

Consider `cons`.
There is a constant number of actual steps and the potential can change by at most 1.
Thus `cons` runs in constant amortised time.

Consider `tail`.
Any `tail` which doesn't empty `f` requires only one step and changes the potential by one for an amortised cost of $\le 2$.
Any `tail` which does empty `f` requires $1 + 2m + \delta$ steps, where $m := \left\lfloor \frac{r}{2} \right\rfloor$, $\left| r \right| = 2m + \delta$.
The linearity is due to the fact that it takes $m$ steps to split `r` in half, then $m$ more steps to reverse the other half.
The change in potential is given by 

$$
\begin{align}
  \left|1 - (2m + \delta)\right| - \left|m - (2m + \delta - m)\right| 
  &= 
  2m + 1 + \delta - \delta 
  \\
  &= 
  2m + 1
.
\end{align}
$$

Thus, the amortised cost is $1 + 2m + \delta - 2m = 1$, showing that `tail` runs in constant amortised time.

Exercise 5.2
------------

Prove that `insert` on binomial heaps runs in $\mathcal O (1)$ amortised time using the banker's method.

Solution 5.2
------------

The credit invariant associates one credit to every binomial tree in the heap.
Let $k$ be the number of calls to `link` made by a call to `insert`.
A call to `insert` takes $1 + k$ actual steps.
It initially adds a tree to the heap, gaining a credit, and each `link` removes a tree, spending a credit.
Thus, the total amortised cost is $(1+k) + 1 - k = 2$.

Exercise 5.3
------------

Prove that the amortised costs of `merge` and `deleteMin` are still $\mathcal O (\log n)$.

Solution 5.3
------------

Let $h_m$, $h_n$ be binomial heaps with potentials $m$, $n$, respectively.
We show that the amortised cost of `merge` is $A(h_m, h_n) \le m+n$.
Let $k$ be the number of calls to `link`.
The actual cost is bounded by $m + n + k$, since there can be at most $m+n$ recursive calls to `merge` and any call reaching the third conditional clause of `merge` will call `link` several times via `insTree`.
We start with a potential of $m+n$, and each call to `link` reduces this by one, for an end potential of $m+n-k$.
The change in potential is $m + n - (m + n - k) = k$.
Thus, the amortised cost of `merge` is $m+n+k -k = m+n$.

Now we show that `deleteMin` is also logarithmic.
We start with a heap $h_n$, which has potential $n$.
There is an actual cost of at most $n$ to find the minimum binary tree, say of rank $r$.
This leaves us with a heap of rank $n-1$.
Then there is an actual cost of at most $r$ to reverse the list of children, making a heap of potential $r$.
Merging these heaps then takes at most $n + r - 1 + k$ steps, where $k$ is the number of calls to `link`, which leaves us with a heap with potential $n + r - 1 - k$.
This is a total of at most $n + r + (n + r - 1 + k)$ steps.
The change in potential is $n - (n + r - 1 - k) = 1 - r + k$.
Thus, the amortised cost of `deleteMin` is 

$$
2n + 2r + k - 1 - (1 - r + k) = 2n + 3r - 2
.
$$

Note that this is indeed logarithmic since, if a heap has a tree of rank $r$, then it must have at least $2^r$ elements; that is, $r = \mathcal O (\log n)$.

Splay Heaps
-----------

A splay heap is a BST that rebalances the tree using a `partition` function when performing update operations.
However, we now allow the insertion of the same element multiple times since we are implementing a heap and not a set.

![`h = foldr insert empty [1..7]`](/images/pfds-splayheap-unbalanced.pdf.png)

![`insert 8 h`](/images/pfds-splayheap-unbalanced-insert.pdf.png)

Exercise 5.4
------------

Implement `smaller`.

Solution 5.4
------------

See [source](https://github.com/stappit/okasaki-pfds/blob/master/src/Chap05/Exercise04.hs).

Exercise 5.5
------------

Prove that `partition` is logarithmic (in the zig-zag case).

Solution 5.5
------------

First we will need a modification to the lemma proved in the book.

Lemma
:   We have the inequality

    $$
    1 + \log x + \log y \le 2\log (x + y -1)
    .
    $$ 

    for all $x \in \mathbb N_{\ge 2}$, $y \in \mathbb N_{\ge 1}$.

Using the basic logarithmic identities, the above inequality is equivalent to $2xy \le (x+y-1)^2$.
In other words, we must show that $x^2 -2x + (y-1)^2 \ge 0$ for $x \ge 2$, $y \ge 1$.
The term with $y$ is non-negative.
The remaining term $x^2 -2x$ is non-negative for any $x \ge 2$.

![Suppose `partition pivot t` outputs $(t_s, t_b)$.](/images/pfds-ex5.5-output.pdf.png)

Define $(p_s, p_b)$ as the output of `partition pivot p`.
Note that $\#t_s + \#t_b = \#t - 1$, so that $1 + \phi(t_s) + \phi(t_b) \le 2\phi(t)$ by the lemma.

$$
\begin{align}
  A (t) 
  &= 
  T (t) + \Phi (t_s) + \Phi (t_b) - \Phi (t)
  \\
  &=
  1 + T (p) + \Phi (t_s) + \Phi (t_b) - \Phi (t)
  \\
  &=
  1 + A (p) - \Phi (p_s) - \Phi (p_b) + \Phi (p) 
  \\
  &\qquad
            + \Phi (t_s) + \Phi (t_b) - \Phi (t)
  \\
  &=
  1 + A (p) - \Phi (p_s) - \Phi (p_b) + \Phi (p)
  \\
  &\qquad
            + \phi (t_s) + \Phi (a_1) + \Phi (p_s)
  \\
  &\qquad
	    + \phi (t_b) + \Phi (p_b) + \Phi (b)
  \\
  &\qquad
	    - \phi (t)   - \phi (s)   - \Phi (b)  - \Phi (a_1) - \Phi (p)
  \\
  &=
  1 + A (p) + \phi (t_s) + \phi (t_b) - \phi (t) - \phi (s)
  \\
  &\le
  2 + 2\phi (p) + \phi(t_s) + \phi(t_b) - \phi(t) - \phi(s)
  \\
  &\le
  2 + \phi(t) + \phi(s) + \phi(t_s) - \phi(t_b) - \phi(t) - \phi(s)
  \\
  &\le
  2 + \phi(t_s) + \phi(t_b)
  \\
  &\le
  1 + 2\phi(t)
\end{align}
$$

Exercise 5.6
------------

Prove that `deleteMin` also runs in logarithmic time.

Solution 5.6
------------

We prove that `deleteMin` runs in $\mathcal O(3\log n)$ amortised time.
Note that $\#a + (\#b + \#c) \le \#s_1$ so that $1 + \phi(a) + \phi(t_2) \le 2\phi(s_1)$.

$$
\begin{align}
  A(s_1)
  &=
  T(s_1) + \Phi(t_1) - \Phi(s_1)
  \\
  &=
  1 + T(a) + \Phi(t_1) - \Phi(s_1)
  \\
  &=
  1 + A(a) - \Phi(a') + \Phi(a)
  \\
  &\qquad
  	+ \phi(t_1) + \phi(t_2) + \Phi(a') + \Phi(b) + \Phi(c)
  \\
  &\qquad
  	- \phi(s_1) - \phi(s_2) - \Phi(a) -  \Phi(b) - \Phi(c)
  \\
  &=
  1 + A(a) + \phi(t_1) + \phi(t_2) - \phi(s_1) -\phi(s_2)
  \\
  &\le
  1 + \phi(a) + \phi(t_1) + \phi(t_2)
  \\
  &\le
  \phi(t_1) + 2\phi(s_1)
  \\
  &\le
  3\phi(s_1)
\end{align}
$$

Exercise 5.7
------------

Write a sorting function that inserts elements into a splay tree and then performs an in order traversal of the tree dumping the elements into a list.
Show that this function takes linear time in a sorted list.

Solution 5.7
------------

See [source](https://github.com/stappit/okasaki-pfds/blob/5cd2c0ae4641edb65ba88f4c7bf0e0a49a23063a/src/Chap05/Exercise07.hs).

Let `xs` be a list of length $n$ in decreasing order.
We can measure the complexity of `sort xs` by counting the number of calls to `partition`.
Every time we call `insert x h`, we know that $x > y$ for all $y$ in `h`, so `insert x h` calls `partition` exactly once.
The function `sort xs` makes a total of $n$ calls to `insert` and thus also $n$ calls to `partition`, showing that `sort` runs in $\mathcal O (n)$ time.

The argument for lists in increasing order is completely analogous.

Pairing Heaps
-------------

A pairing heap is a heap-ordered multiway tree whose `deleteMin` operation merges the children in pairs.

![`h = foldr insert empty [7, 6..1]`](/images/pfds-pairingheap-wide.pdf.png)

![`deleteMin h`](/images/pfds-pairingheap-wide-deletemin.pdf.png)

Exercise 5.8
------------

1.  Write a function `toBinary` that converts pairing heaps to binary trees.

2.  Reimplement pairing heaps using this new representation as binary trees.

3.  Prove that `deleteMin` and `merge` still run in logarithmic amortised time in this new representation.

Solution 5.8
------------

**Item 1.**

See [source](https://github.com/stappit/okasaki-pfds/blob/897522b05776b202e622b55b03cd0438dd581798/src/Chap05/Exercise08.hs).

The conversion from a pairing heap to a binary tree is explained in the book.

![For any binary tree derived from a pairing heap, $x \le y, y_a, y_b$ for all elements $y_a, y_b$ in the trees $a, b$, respectively.
  The right child of the root is empty.
  The values in $b$ are not related to $y$.
](/images/pfds_ex5-8b_invariant.pdf.png)

The invariant on a pairing heap `T x cs` is that `x` is no greater than any of the elements of its children in `cs`.
This translates into the binary tree invariant that a node is no greater than any of its left descendants.
That is, for `T' x (T' y a b) c` we have that $x \le y, y_a, y_b$ for all elements $y_a, y_b$ in the trees $a, b$, respectively.
The value of $x$ bears no relation to the values in $c$.

We also maintain a second invariant: the right child of the root is empty.

**Item 2.**

See [source](https://github.com/stappit/okasaki-pfds/blob/897522b05776b202e622b55b03cd0438dd581798/src/Chap05/Data/PairingHeap/Exercise08.hs).

Remember that the root of a binary tree representation of a pairing heap has no right child (it is empty).
Thus we can forget about the right child without losing desired information.

**Item 3.**

We start with `merge`.
Note that for any $x, y \ge 2$, we have $\log (x+y) \le \log x + \log y$.
In particular, $\#s_k \ge 2$.

$$
\begin{align}
  A (s_1, s_2) 
  &= 
  T (s_1, s_2) + \Phi (t_1) - \Phi (s_1) - \Phi (s_2)
  \\
  &=
  1 + \Phi(t_1) - \Phi(s_1) - \Phi(s_2)
  \\
  &=
  1 + \phi(t_1) + \phi(t_2) - \phi(s_1) - \phi(s_2)
  \\
  &\le
  2 + 2\phi(t_1)
  \\
  &\le
  2 + 2\log (\#s_1 + \#s_2)
  \\
  &\le
  2 + 2\log(\#s_1) + 2\log(\#s_2)
  \\
  &\le
  2 + 2\phi(s_1) + 2\phi(s_2)
\end{align}
$$

Now consider `deleteMin`.
I was unable to find a nice solution by myself.
The following comes from [The Pairing Heap: A New Form of Self-Adjusting Heap](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sleator/papers/pairing-heaps.pdf). 
We reproduce their argument that the asymptotic cost of `deleteMin` is $A(s_1) \le 2\phi(s_1) + 3$.


There are at most $2k+1$ calls to `merge`, where $k$ is the number of children of the root of the pairing heap.
The difficult part is calculating the potential increase, which we do in steps.

Lemma 1
: Let $x, y > 0$ such that $x + y \le 1$.
  Then $\log x + \log y \le -2$.

Proof.
This follows from the fact that $xy \le x(1-x)$, which has a maximum of $\frac{1}{4}$ at $x = \frac{1}{2}$.

â–¡

Corollary
:   We have 

    $$
    \log(x + y) - \log(y + z) \le 2 \log (x + y + z) - 2\log z - 2
    ,
    $$

    for any $x, y, z \ge 0$.

Proof.
By the lemma we have

$$
\begin{align}
  \log(x + y) + \log z - 2\log (x + y + z) 
  &= 
  \log \left(\frac{x + y}{x + y + z}\right) + \log \left(\frac{z}{x + y + z}\right) 
  \\
  &\le 
  -2.
\end{align}
$$

Now

$$
\begin{align}
 \log(x + y) - \log(y + z) 
 &= 
 \log(x + y) + \log z - \log z - \log(y+z)
 \\
 &\le
 2\log (x + y + z) - 2 - \log z -\log(y+z)
 \\
 &\le
 2\log (x + y + z) - 2 - 2\log z.
\end{align}
$$

Lemma
: Define $s_2$ to be the tree `T y b c` and $s_1$ to be the tree `T x a s2`.  
  Then applying `merge` to $s_1$ results in a potential increase of at most $2\phi(s_1) - 2\phi(c) - 2$.

Proof.
Without loss of generality, assume $y \le x$.
Define $t_2$ to be the tree `T x a b` and $t_1$ to be `T y t2 c`; that is, $t_1$ is the result of applying `merge` to $s_1$.
The potential increase is $\Phi(t_1) - \Phi(s_1)$, by definition.
This expands to $\phi(t_1) + \phi(t_2) - \phi(s_1) - \phi(s_2)$, which is equal to $\phi(t_2) - \phi(s_2)$ since $\phi(t_1) = \phi(s_1)$.
Now 

$$
\begin{align}
  \phi(t_2) - \phi(s_2) 
  &= 
  \log(\#a + \#b) - \phi(\#b + \#c) 
  \\
  &\le 
  2\log(\#a + \#b + \#c) - 2\log (\#c) - 2 
  \\
  &= 
  2\phi(s_1) - 2\phi(c) - 2.
\end{align}
$$

Corollary
: Define $s_i$ as the right child of $s_{i-1}$, where $s_1$ is the root of the binary tree, $i = 1, ..., 2k - 1$, and $2k + \delta$ is the length of the right spine of $s_1$.
  Then the net increase in potential over all calls to `merge` in the downwards pass of `mergePairs` is bounded by $2\phi(s_1) - 2(k-1)$.

Proof.
Applying the previous lemma yields

$$
\begin{align}
  2\phi(s_{2k-1}) + \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \left( 2\phi(s_{2i - 1}) - 2\phi(s_{2i + 1}) - 2 \right)
  &\le
  2\phi(s_{2k-1}) - 2(k-1) + \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \left( 2\phi(s_{2i - 1}) - 2\phi(s_{2i + 1}) \right)
  \\
  &\le
  2\phi(s_1) - 2(k-1),
\end{align}
$$

where the last line follows by telescoping the sum.

Lemma
: The net increase in potential over all calls to merge in the upwards pass of `mergePairs` is bounded by $\phi(s_1)$.

Proof.
Let $t$ be the resulting tree after calling `merge` on two trees $t_1, t_2$.
Furthermore, let $t_1', t_2'$ be the subtrees whose roots contain the keys of the trees $t_1, t_2$, respectively.
Then $\phi(t_1) \le \phi(t_1')$ and $\phi(t_2) \ge \phi(t_2')$.
Thus, the potential increase is bounded by $\phi(t)$.
Since $\#t = \#s_1$, the potential increase is bounded by $\phi(s_1)$.

â–¡

There are at most $2k + 1$ actual steps.
Removing the root causes a potential increase of $-\phi(s_1)$.
The potential increase in the downwards pass in `mergePairs` is bounded by $2\phi(s_1) - 2(k-1)$.
The potential increase in the upwards pass in `mergePairs` is bounded by $\phi(s_1)$.
Therefore, the amortised time is bounded by 

$$
2k + 1 - \phi(s_1) + 2\phi(s_1) - 2(k-1) + \phi(s_1) = 3 + 2\phi(s_1)
.
$$

Exercise 5.9
------------

Give examples of sequences of operations for which binomial heaps, splay heaps, and pairing heaps take much longer than indicated by their amortised bounds.

Solution 5.9
------------

For any operation with amortised bounds, we can set up the data structure so that the next execution of that operation is expensive, then call that operation many times.

**Binomial Heaps**

Binomial heaps support an `insert` operation with a constant amortised cost.
The worst case cost of `insert` is $\mathcal O (\log n)$, which occurs when inserting into a binomial heap of size $2^m - 1$.
In a persistent setting, we can call `insert` k times on this heap, executing in $\mathcal O(k\log n)$ time instead of $\mathcal O(k)$.

```haskell
heap = foldr insert empty [1..(2^m - 1)]
  where
    m = 7
    n = 2^m - 1

tooSlow = map (insert 0) . replicate k $ heap
  where
    k = 100
```

**Splay Heaps**

Splay heaps support a `findMin` operation with a logarithmic amortised cost.
The worst case cost of `findMin` is linear, which occurs after inserting numbers in increasing order into the empty heap.
In a persistent setting, we can call `findMin` k times on this heap, executing in $\mathcal O(kn)$ time instead of $\mathcal O(k\log n)$.

```haskell
heap = foldr insert empty [1..n]
  where
    n = 100

tooSlow = map findMin . replicate k $ heap
  where 
    k = 100
```

**Pairing Heaps**

Pairing heaps have a `deleteMin` operation with an amortised cost of $\mathcal O (\log n)$.
The worst case cost of `deleteMin` is $\mathcal O (n)$, which occurs after inserting numbers in decreasing order into the empty heap.
In a persistent setting, we can call `deleteMin` k times on this heap, executing in $\mathcal O(kn)$ time instead of $\mathcal O(k\log n)$.

```haskell
heap = foldr insert empty [n, (n-1)..1]
  where
    n = 100

tooSlow = map deleteMin . replicate k $ heap
  where 
    k = 100
```
